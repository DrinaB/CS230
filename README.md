# CS230 Module Eight Journal

### 1. **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
   - **Client**: The Gaming Room.
   - **Software Requirements**: The Gaming room wanted a web-based game that could serve multiple platforms, based on their existing Android app, Draw It or Lose It. The software needed to support multi-user gameplay, manage unique game and team names, allow multiple teams and players, and ensure only one instance of the game is in memory at a time.

### 2. **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
   - I focused on creating clear, detailed documentation that directly addressed the client’s specific software requirements. This helped ensure alignment with their needs and expectations, which contributed to a streamlined development process.

### 3. **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
   - Developing the design document helped clarify the project requirements and structure, making the transition from planning to coding smoother and reducing ambiguity. This structured approach provided a strong foundation for the actual coding phase.

### 4. **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
   - If I were to revise any part of my documentation, I would enhance the technical specifications by adding more detailed examples of potential user interactions. This would improve the clarity of user flows and help both developers and stakeholders better understand the expected functionality.

### 5. **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
   - I focused on understanding and translating the user's requirements—such as multi-platform functionality, single-instance control, and unique naming—into the design. Considering user needs is essential, as it drives functionality and ensures the software meets the intended purpose, thereby enhancing user satisfaction.

### 6. **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
   - In designing the software, I used techniques like requirement analysis and modular design to structure the application. In future projects, I would:
     1. Conduct user story workshops to capture detailed user needs.
     2. Apply iterative prototyping to validate design assumptions.
     3. Use pattern-driven design, such as Singleton for unique instances and Iterator for seamless data handling, to manage similar application requirements effectively.
